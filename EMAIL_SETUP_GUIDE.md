# Email Notifications Setup Guide for Credit Applications

This guide will help you set up email notifications for your Mint Lease credit application form.

## ðŸ“§ **Gmail Setup (Recommended)**

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Under "Signing in to Google", click **"2-Step Verification"**
3. Follow the setup process to enable 2FA

### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Under "Signing in to Google", click **"App passwords"**
3. Select app: **"Mail"**
4. Select device: **"Other (custom name)"**
5. Enter name: **"Mint Lease Website"**
6. Click **"Generate"**
7. **Copy the 16-character password** (you'll need this for EMAIL_PASSWORD)

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Email Configuration for Credit Application Notifications
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=your-business-email@gmail.com
```

**Replace with your actual values:**
- `EMAIL_USER`: Your Gmail address
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: The 16-character app password from Step 2
- `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL`: Where you want to receive credit application emails

## ðŸ”§ **Alternative Email Providers**

### For Outlook/Hotmail:
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=your-business-email@outlook.com
```

### For Yahoo:
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@yahoo.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=your-business-email@yahoo.com
```

### For Custom SMTP:
Update `src/lib/emailService.ts`:
```typescript
this.transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  host: 'your-smtp-server.com',
  port: 587,
  secure: false, // true for 465, false for other ports
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD,
  },
})
```

## ðŸ§ª **Testing the Setup**

### Step 1: Test API Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/submit-credit-application
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "Credit application API endpoint is working",
  "emailConfigured": true,
  "notificationEmail": "your-email@gmail.com"
}
```

### Step 2: Test Form Submission
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/credit-application`
2. Fill out the multi-step form completely
3. Submit the application
4. Check your email for two messages:
   - **Business notification** (detailed application data)
   - **Applicant confirmation** (sent to the applicant)

## ðŸ“¬ **What You'll Receive**
